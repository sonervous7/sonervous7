# 👋 Hi there! I'm Jakub Buszyński

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student at the Wrocław University of Science and Technology (2nd year).  
🧠 I'm a member of the **Solvro Scientific Circle**, where I focus on Machine Learning and AI projects.

## 💻 About me
I'm passionate about **Machine Learning**, **AI**, and especially **Large Language Models** (LLMs).  
Currently exploring topics like **transformers**, **NLP**, and how models like ChatGPT actually work.

I enjoy building things that help me learn — many of the projects here were created as university assignments, but I always try to go beyond the minimum. 💡
